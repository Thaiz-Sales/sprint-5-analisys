Creating and implementing a web application dashboard on a cloud service.

This web application provides a simple and effective tool to perform an initial exploratory analysis of car sales advertisement data, focusing on mileage distribution and its relationship with price.

The web application offers the following key functionalities:

Visualization of Mileage Distribution (Odometer): Through an interactive histogram, users can visualize the frequency of different mileage bands across advertised vehicles. This helps to understand the overall distribution of mileage across cars in the dataset.

Analysis of Mileage to Price Relationship: An interactive scatterplot allows users to explore the possible correlation between a vehicleâ€™s mileage and its selling price. Users can identify if there is any general price trend in relation to mileage.
